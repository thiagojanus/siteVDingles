              Hello, I'm Lucas, I'm 16 years old and I study at Etec in Ribeirão Pires. I like to write, play with friends, practice physical exercises and sports. One of my passions is programming and creating game-related designs. In my free time, I go to the gym and play football. I intend to pursue a career in the field that interests me.
            </p>
            <p>
              From a young age, I discovered the power of words to express my ideas and stories. I love getting together with my friends to play exciting video games or participate in sports activities, where I learn valuable lessons about collaboration and communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              My creative vein is expressed through programming and design, creating characters and virtual environments. I often find myself at the gym, working out to keep my body and mind healthy. Football is another of my passions, providing adrenaline and fun with friends. In the future, I'm looking for a career that unites my passions for writing, programming and design. My life is a journey of constant learning, where every day is a chance to expand my knowledge and create exciting projects, surrounded by incredible people.
